# GifTastic

I made a Russia-inspired app that pulls GIFs with the GIPHY API.

The app has a few buttons already on the page. The user can add more buttons by entering new terms into the input field.

When the buttons are clicked, 10 GIFs are pulled from GIPHY's database and displayed as still images. The images can be clicked to animate them, and they can be clicked again to revert them into a still state.
